# Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites

Before we can start building, you need to have Node.js installed on your Mac.

### Check if Node.js is installed:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

### If Node.js is NOT installed:

**Option 1: Install via Homebrew (Recommended)**
```bash
brew install node
```

**Option 2: Download from official website**
1. Go to https://nodejs.org/
2. Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version for macOS
3. Run the installer
4. Restart your terminal

### Verify Installation:
After installing, run:
```bash
node --version  # Should show v18.x.x or higher
npm --version   # Should show 9.x.x or higher
```

## Once Node.js is installed:

We'll set up the Next.js project with:
- Next.js 14 (React framework)
- TypeScript (type-safe JavaScript)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- All necessary dependencies

Let me know when you have Node.js installed, and I'll proceed with the project setup!
